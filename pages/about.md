# Unboxing Early Modern Latin America

## Introduction

Boxes are objects which at once extend and contain their makers’ and users’ contact with the world. Then as now, they traveled the globe, moving between cultures and amongst sellers, consumers, and collectors. 

With online shopping and shipping, they have proliferated in our world as symbols of consumerism, as fodder for YouTube and TikTok videos, and as useful nuisances, littering our landscapes though they have not occupied the same space in scholarly studies. 

Usually an afterthought or even discarded entirely, boxes were often luxury goods themselves, made by skilled craftspersons with significant care and attention to detail. Boxes contain, store, hide, protect, wrap, package, and encase, but they can also reveal, expose, manifest, exhibit, and even release. 

Here we turn attention to the box as a signifier and site of meaning. This collection features objects from [LACMA](https://www.lacma.org/), the [MET](https://www.metmuseum.org/), and the [Brooklyn Museum](https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/).

### Hide

In this section, we consider how objects may hide. 

### Reveal

In this section, we look at how these containers reveal. 

## Conclusion

This exhibition aims to *lift the lid* of what is so often hidden away in the world or "ordinary things" to demonstrate how these objects, in their movement between concealing and revealing, are actually *extra*ordinary.
